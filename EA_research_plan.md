# Research plan for electoral analysis, species representation

## Research questions
### How represented are TS spatially?
* How many TS reside within each electorate? [x]
* How many TS do not reside in any electorates?/Or have >80% of their range outside electorates? [?]
* How many electorates does each TS's range cover? [?]
* Where (electorates, demographic classification) are TS most concentrated? [?]
* Which electorates have species with >80% of their range? [?]
* How many electorates contain endemic species? [?]
* How does the number of electorates covered in a species's range relate to their status?
    * If I want extinct species, I have to pull from the SPRAT and is there GIS info for them?
* How does species distribution relate to AECâ€™s demographic classification? [?]
    * '60% of TS occur in urban areas'...

### How represented are TS by political groupings?
* How much TS range does each political grouping (e.g. party, independent) control?
* How does political grouping relate to the status of species?
* How does political grouping relate to the up/down listings of TS?
    * Who is presiding over the majority of up/down listings of TS?

### How does TS representation compare temporally?
* How do temporal electorate affiliations (long-held VS swing seats) relate to the status of TS?
    * Tally up number of flips each seat has experienced, correlate with 
* How have individual TS statuses changed temporally?
