# baleful-pantomime [electoral_analysis]

## To do:
* GET unique values of each attribute to sus if the SNES data needs to be subsetted i.e. what does <NA> mean for threatened status? Not threatened? -> then pitch these questions to Kearney/Michelle

## Questions:
* Do the same species's range overlap ever?
* Act came in in 1999, how could I integrate historical data into my analyses?
* How does range/distribution relate to habitat with this data?
  * Is there a way of pulling out/getting (critical) habitat for EPBC act listed species?
