This respository contains the scripts behind the analysis of the currently in preprint article ["The intersection between elected representatives and threatened species recovery"](https://doi.org/10.32942/X2BC75).

The code is thin in the details on why certain steps were undertaken and somewhat convoluted, mainly because it is circumstantial to the data we used and my level of programming knowledge. I would advise checking out [Threatened Australians](https://github.com/threatenedaustralians/threatened-australians). I did that project after this one and have written Rmd files for the analysis and it essentially produces the same database. It also would be easier to replicate/transfer to a new country.
