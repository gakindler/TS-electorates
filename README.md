# baleful-pantomime [electoral_analysis]

## To do:

## Questions:
* When joining, should I set a buffer zone around electorates, i.e. 1km to account for movement of wildlife?
* How clean is this data?
* Do the same species's range overlap ever?
* Act came in 1999, how could I integrate historical data into my analyses
* Can direct SNES questions to Stephen K
* How does range/distribution relate to habitat with this data?
* Is there a way of pulling out/getting critical habitat for EPBC act listed species?
