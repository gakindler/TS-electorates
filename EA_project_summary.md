# Electoral analysis

## To do:
* What do I need to do about "MIGRATORY_STATUS" "MARINE" "CETACEAN" when comes to "THREATENED_STATUS"?

## Questions:
* Act came in in 1999, how could I integrate historical data into my analyses?
* How to do an antijoin? In ArcGIS or sf?

## Chatting with Tash (09/08/21)
* On the back of MM and JW being like 'you guys should have a chat'
* Not entirely sure where the intersection is but we ran with it and came up with for post first-paper EA, integrating Spending to Save data into the analysis could be cool
* Originally I only had plans to use the MERIT data, which encompasses only the National Landcare Program (only one line of the budget)
* Tash is going to send me her data to potentially bring the Spending to Save data up to date
* Tash coded the data using her own judgement, no expert elicitation

## Chatting with Rich (10/08/21)
* Conservation measures? - PA overlap within each electorate, vegetation intactness/land clearing or larger threats
* Dataset survey by UQ of enviro motivations
* How do conser. actions differ on the ground in these
* Try not to be polemic when communicating the answers to these questions

## Preso at lab meeting (28/09/21)
* Sean - Actions needed in each electorate, needed to ameliorate pressures
* Sean - Environmental condition score
* Divya - Measure the ammount each constituency engages (e.g. writings to members, public consultations etc)
* Jeremy - History of species within each electorate, extinctions? Ranges?
* Sean - the reliance of individual companies on economic value provided by companies, build the case for politicians to push it?
* Sean - social media engagement with biodivesity areas, concepts etc - ask the social media companies for this data?
* Sean - traditional owner maps, which mobs could walk through plans?
* Stephen - species unit per area
* Stephen - inverse relationship between distribution of species and electorates, inferential stats to pull this out?
* James - electorates with number of species within x/y histogram, two sections here - one is species that reside in singular electorates need a champion. Other is species that have like >50 electorates is a democracy deficit
